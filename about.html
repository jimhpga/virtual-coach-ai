    <h1>About Virtual Coach AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Jim Hartnett</strong> is a PGA professional with 30+ years of coaching experience at top facilities including Kapalua, PGA West, <strong>Sahalee Country Club</strong>, and other great facilities. He has worked with legendary coach <strong>Jim McLean</strong> and studied the methods of the top teachers in the country.</p>
    <p>For decades Jim tracked the game and swing tendencies of the great players in detailed—video, charts, and yes, mountains of Excel—studying biomechanics and the mental game to find what actually moves the needle for real golfers.</p>
    <p>Now, with AI, that same tour-level analysis happens instantly. Virtual Coach AI brings the <strong>complete tour experience</strong>—biomechanical diagnostics, precise comparisons, mental training, and data-driven practice plans—to every golfer, anywhere.</p>

    <h2>Why AI Changes the Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sees what humans miss:</strong> subtle patterns and micro-movements most instructors can’t reliably spot in real time.</li>
      <li><strong>Objective, repeatable:</strong> frame-by-frame checkpoints (P1–P9) with consistent scoring—no “good day / bad day” bias.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized drills:</strong> prescriptions based on your body, tendencies, and goals—not generic tips.</li>
      <li><strong>Progress you can prove:</strong> trends over time for swing, decisions, and scoring—so you know what’s working.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>Bring tour-player clarity to every golfer: better decisions, better swings, lower scores. If it doesn’t help your golf, it doesn’t ship.</p>
