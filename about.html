      <h1>About Virtual Coach AI</h1>
      <p>
        Jim Hartnett is a PGA professional with over 30 years of experience,
        having taught at some of the top golf facilities in the world, including
        Kapalua, PGA West, Sahalee Country Club, and more. He has worked with
        renowned instructors like Jim McLean and studied the methods of the top
        teachers in the game.

        Jim has spent decades refining his teaching, using video analysis,
        biomechanics data, and years of practical experience. Now, with the
        power of Artificial Intelligence, he’s able to bring a full tour-player
        coaching experience to every golfer — not just the pros.

        Virtual Coach AI doesn’t just record swings — it analyzes every
        checkpoint (P1–P9) with biomechanical precision, finds inefficiencies,
        and prescribes drills tailored to the player’s body and goals. AI can
        spot patterns and micro-movements that most instructors simply can’t
        see in real time, giving every golfer the insights once reserved for
        tour players.
