  "swingSummary": {
    "paragraph": "Your overall power score is 91% with a 3:1 tempo and 86% release timing. The strongest areas are setup quality, takeaway structure, and late-downswing alignments; the biggest opportunity is sharpening the transition into P5 and controlling low-point at P7. Over the next two weeks, bias training towards early pressure shift, lead-leg braking, and release timing. Keep reps short (10–12 balls) and finish each with a balanced hold.",
