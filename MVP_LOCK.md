# Virtual Coach AI — MVP LOCK

If you change anything in these areas, you must test:
- Upload → Analyze → Frames populate → Report renders
- Reset Demo
- Scoreboard values render
- P1–P10 strip + jump works

## Locked behaviors
1) No refactors in core flow during MVP demo window.
2) Reports must remain pixel-identical.
3) Do not change scoring outputs without versioning.

## Core areas (edit with caution)
- Report UI (report-beta / pose-demo)
- Scoreboard + narrative blocks
- Upload/analyze routes
