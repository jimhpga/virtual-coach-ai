    <h1>About Virtual Coach AI</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Jim Hartnett</strong> is a PGA professional with over 30 years of experience, having taught and coached at some of the top golf facilities in the country — including Kapalua, PGA West, Sahalee Country Club, and Hawley Country Club.</p>
      <p>Jim has worked alongside and learned from some of the most respected names in golf instruction, including legendary coach <strong>Jim McLean</strong>, and has studied the methods of the top teachers in the country to refine his own approach to player improvement.</p>
      <p>Over his career, Jim has relentlessly analyzed the golf swing — from biomechanics to mental performance — logging patterns, numbers, and tendencies in ways that once required mountains of video, charts, and Excel spreadsheets.</p>
      <p>Now, with the advent of artificial intelligence, that same deep analysis can be delivered instantly. Virtual Coach AI brings what was once reserved for tour players — full biomechanical diagnostics, precision comparisons, and data-driven improvement plans — directly to every golfer, anywhere in the world.</p>

      <h2>What AI Brings That Cameras & Coaches Alone Can’t</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Frame-by-frame biomechanical analysis at every swing checkpoint (P1–P9).</li>
        <li>Instant detection of subtle faults most coaches can’t see with the naked eye.</li>
        <li>Personalized drills based on your unique body, movement patterns, and goals.</li>
        <li>Objective data tracking over time — no guesswork, no memory gaps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>Virtual Coach AI exists to give every golfer the tools, feedback, and training once only accessible to the best players in the world. It’s not just swing data — it’s the <strong>complete tour experience</strong>, powered by technology that never blinks, never forgets, and never stops working to make your game better.</p>
